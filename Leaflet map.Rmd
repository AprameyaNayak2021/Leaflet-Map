## Leaflet Map
Leaflet is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps, often used for embedding maps on web pages. It provides easy-to-use functions to add markers, popups, and layers, allowing developers to customize maps with minimal code. Leaflet is widely used because of its simplicity, flexibility, and compatibility with mobile and desktop devices, making it ideal for mapping applications. This RMD file contains a leaflet map that can be interacted with on R Pubs where it will be hosted as per the course requirments. Benrath Palace is a beautiful Rococo palace located in Düsseldorf, Germany. This map includes a clickable marker with an image and a link to the palace’s homepage.

  iconAnchorX = 30 * 408 / 255 / 2, iconAnchorY = 30 / 2
