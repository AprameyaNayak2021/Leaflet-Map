# Leaflet-Map


## Overview

My first leaflet map to show an interactive map on a rpubs hosted webpage. This project demonstrates the use of the **Leaflet** library in R to create an interactive map featuring Benrath Palace, a beautiful Rococo palace located in Düsseldorf, Germany. The map includes a clickable marker that opens a popup with an image of the palace and a link to its homepage.

## Features

- Interactive map created with Leaflet.
- Clickable marker indicating the location of Benrath Palace.
- Popup displaying an image and a link to the palace’s official website.

## Requirements

- R packages:
  - `leaflet`
  - `htmltools`

## Hosting
The final output will be hosted on RPubs, making it accessible for interactive use.

Thank you for reading :D
